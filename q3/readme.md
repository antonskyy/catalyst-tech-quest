# Question #3

A pretty good example of a situation where BDD wouldn't be a good approach is (ahem) my current situation - where a sole developer interacts with internal end-users directly on daily and hourly basis. There isn't much need for an additional methodology or framework to encourage communication between stakeholders :)

Jokes aside (and being honest), I don't have an in-depth understanding of BDD processes but reckon it wouldn't be advantageous where there's a limited or delayed communication between the dev team and the customer, such as where development work is outsourced to an external company and communication between developers and customers requires an intermediary.
